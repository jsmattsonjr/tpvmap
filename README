Chrome extension: Overlay TrainingPeaks Virtual satellite image over activity maps

Alpha quality. When it gets better, I'll submit it to the Chrome Web Store.

Currently works well with Strava activities, but not the Strava feed.
Also works well with VeloViewer segmentsis and VeloViewer activities.
Works well with intervals.icu activities.
Ironically, does not work with TrainingPeaks activities.

To use:

Clone the git repo or download and uncompress the ZIP archive.
In Chrome, open chrome://extensions.
Toggle Developer Mode on.
Click 'Load unpacked' and navigate to the repo/archive.
